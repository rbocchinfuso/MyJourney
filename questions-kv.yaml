What is the most fun about your job?:
  - Preparting this for today was pretty fun!
  - This is pretty fun!
  - I have alwasys loved solving problems, and that is still the favorite part of my job.
  - Who knows what this is a picture of?
How many years have you been coding?:
  - This is tricky question.
  - I probably wrote my first program around your age, 5th grade, in BASIC.  This is about when I traded my Etch-a-Sketch for a computer.
  - 10 PRINT ``Rich``
  - 20 GOTO 10
  - I never really stopped, so I guess I have been coding for about 37 years.
How did you start liking coding?:
    - I had an uncle who had a Commodore VIC-20 and then Commodor 64 and he was really passionate about problem solving.
    - I grew up in the city of Philadelphia and my uncle lived in the suburbs of New Jersey, so we would visit quite a bit.
    - While my parents would visit with the adults, I would sit in front of the computer reading his BASIC programming books and learning to make the Computer do things that I wanted it to do.
    - Like the Etch-a-Sketch, the computer was an endless electronic canvas for experimentation, and it provided me with the freedom to fail, over and over again, but eventually succeed and look back on all the work I had put into solving the problem and I was proud of what I had accomplished.
    - These feelings are no different nearly 40 years later.
How did you pursue coding?:
  - I am still in pursuit!
  - BUT I worked hard in grade school, I took what few classes were available on the Apple IIe and TRS-80.
  - When I got to high school I was lucky enough to get into Pascal and C programming classes.
  - Sitting in front of a computer is what I have loved to do for a long time.
  - I went on to get a a Bachelors degree in Computer Science, a Masters Degree in Computer Information Systems and a Masters defgree in Cybersecurity.
  - I love to learn. It`s really my only advantage.
Have you always wanted to be a coder?:
  - I have like ZERO artistic talent.
  - My dad is an electician and he taught be a lot about a lot of things when I was a kid.
  - I wouldn`t say I have always known that I wanted to be Coder.
  - I have always known that I wanted to be a Maker, I wanted to build things.
  - I always enjoyed workng with my hands and I love logic and structure, when I discovered the computer it was a canvas that allowed me to be creative, to think freely, to fail over and over and learn from failure.
What kind of coding do you do for your job?:
  - Almost everything I do is what the software industry would call backend development.
  - I am what we call a DevOps engineer, I write code that automates tasks.
  - Have you ever walked up to a door an it just opens?  The process of recognizing you are there, opening the door, then closing it behind you requires code.
  - Most of the tasks we don`t think about happen because someone coded the logic for us, so we don`t have to think about it.  Computers are extremely good at repetitive tasks.
What schooling did you get for your job?:
  - Talked about his a little bit eariler.
  - Things are moving faster than ever, and you have to keep learning.
  - The most important thing I have learned though education is how to think, how to be a philospher, because thinking of new ways to solve problems requires orginal thought.  It requires philosphy, the combination of what you know, what you think you know, curiosity and a willingness to fail.
At your place of work, how much do coders make?:
  - Depends on how good you are.
  - If you are OK you can make a very comfortable living.
  - If you are really good and can find special ways to solve complex problems you can do very well.
  - I lead a team of 40 engineers, and what I will tell you the same thing I tell them.
What has been your greatest coding challenge?:
  - Good question.
  - Tough question.
  - As a coder I follow Thomas Edison`s advice ``There`s a way to do it better - find it.``  This means that everyday I challenge myself to improve on the solution that I came up with yesterday.  I even did it with this simple task, and I am pleased, but not satisfied.
  - With this said, in college I did an intership for a company and it was really the first applicaiton I had to develop on my own, it was pretty tough, I think mostly because of inexperience and I was just unsure of myself and nervous, which made it very stressful.
  - Fear can paralyze you.
  - I am never satisfied, and I always think I can improve my work.  It is part of what I think makes me a good developer, but like anything you love it can frustrate you at times.
Do you ever get bored of coding?:
  - Never.
  - I never tire of experimenting and finding better ways to solve problems.
  - If I could codify everything, I would.
From 1-10, how do you rate coding?:
  - 11
  - I love finding better ways to do things.
Have you ever made any games?:
  - It`s been a while since I have made a game, and the games I created wouldn`t be consider interesting by todays standards.
  - You might think this game looks boring, but I can tell you that writing Pong 30 years ago wasn't the same as writing pong today.
